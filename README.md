# Python-Calculator-App

This is a calculator application I made with Python using the "Tkinter" import.

There are three main functions that have been written in the code; def add_to_area (which adds a number to the text area), def cal (which calculates the numbers), and, def empty_area (which clears the text area).

The app is spread across a 300x450 pixel window area and is not resizeable, this has been done to make it small and compact, instead of having to deal with multiple different resolution variations (e.g. stretching the app to extreme length across the screen thus making it unreadable).
Additionally, the buttons used on the app have been purposely spaced out to make the app look balanced and neat. 

Total amount of buttons: 19

Amount of numbers: 10 (ranging from 0-9)

Amount of operators: 9 (consisting of "+ ", "-" , "*" , "/" , "(" , ")" , "." , "Clear" , "=")

To use the application, run the Python code and it will pop up and appear on the screen. A user inputs numbers/operators (except %) from the keyboard or uses the numpad, however, it is possible to write letters into the text area although this has no effect on the calculation
at any point and will be deleted once a number or operator has been pressed from the methods as mentioned earlier. To close the calculator, simply click on the right "X" on the top-right of the screen.
